# TWAS-Motor-Control
Code needed to operate three Texas Instruments DRV8711 for two stepper motors and one actuator. Files will be separated into the 'Libraries', 'src', and a single sketch file intended for use with the Arduino IDE.

Note the 'Libraries' directory needs to be copied into the 'libraries' folder being used by the Arduino IDE.

# Future Implementations
The following are a list of implementations that would be great additions in the future. 

-Adding a rotary encoder to provide feedback for implementing a closed-loop control system.

-UART Communication to output pivot point position.

-Integration to a Labview GUI.

-LCD screen to display stiffness per track.

-Frequency knob to alter the step signal frequency and speed at which the stepper motors rotate.
