# Breadboard-Demonstration
Code needed to operate three Texas Instruments DRV8711 for two stepper motors and one actuator.
Files will be separated into the 'Libraries' and 'Sketches' that the Arduino IDE can work with.
Note the 'src' directory needs to be copied into whichever sketch folder will be used to test with.
